Remote Repos by default have the name origin assigned to them

git remote -v --> gives us the urls associtated with origin remote. One is used to fetch data from remote repo and other used to push data to remote repo
 
Here I am pushing some changes into a local repo and a non main branch. then will try to push these changes into a similar non main branch on remote repo
